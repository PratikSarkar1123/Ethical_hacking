# Adobe Penetration Test Report - 25 June 2025

## Executive Summary
Conducted network penetration testing on 40 employee IP addresses, identifying critical vulnerabilities including a high-severity command injection vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) in a smart watch device.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap** - Network scanning and service enumeration
- **OpenVAS** - Vulnerability assessment and reporting

## Methodology

### 1. Nmap Scanning
```bash
nmap -sV --script=vuln -iL targets.txt -oN vuln_report.txt
```
**Purpose**: 
- Service version detection (`-sV`)
- Vulnerability script scanning (`--script=vuln`)
- Input from target list (`-iL targets.txt`)
- Output to file (`-oN vuln_report.txt`)

### 2. OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanning
**OpenVAS Overview**: 
Open-source vulnerability scanner part of Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) that:
- Automates vulnerability detection
- Identifies outdated software/misconfigurations
- Provides prioritized risk assessment
- Supports compliance verification

**Installation on Kali Linux**:
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install OpenVAS
sudo apt install openvas -y

# Initial setup (credentials will be displayed)
sudo gvm-setup

# Start/stop services
sudo gvm-start
sudo gvm-stop

# Verify installation
sudo gvm-check-setup

# Manual vulnerability DB update
sudo greenbone-nvt-sync
sudo greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA
sudo greenbone-feed-sync --type SCAP
sudo greenbone-feed-sync --type CERT
```

**Scan Configuration**:
1. Created target list from IP CSV file
2. Selected "Full and Fast Ultimate" scan profile
3. Used default scan parameters
4. Generated comprehensive reports (HTML/PDF/CSV)

## Critical Findings

### High Severity Vulnerability
- **Type**: Command Injection
- **Affected Device**: Smart Watch
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)
- **CVE**: [Reference number from report]
- **Risk**: Remote code execution possible

## Exploitation Path
1. Craft malicious payload for command injection
2. Deliver payload through vulnerable interface
3. Establish reverse shell
4. Escalate privileges
5. Maintain persistence (if required by scope)

## Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate affected smart watch devices
   - Apply vendor-provided patches
   - Update to version [specify patched version]

2. **Long-term**:
   - Implement input validation
   - Deploy web application firewall
   - Establish regular vulnerability scanning

## Next Steps
1. Validate exploit with proof-of-concept (if authorized)
2. Coordinate remediation timeline with IT team
3. Schedule rescan after patch implementation

## Report Files
- `vuln_report.txt` - Nmap findings
- `openvas_report_[date].pdf` - Full vulnerability assessment
